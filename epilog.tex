In this work we have identified bitmaps as one of the most used data
structure in GCC and one of its biggest users, the interprocedural
points-to analysis. We have enhanced this algorithm with a new data structure
based on Bloom filters, the Bloomap. In the link-time optimization of Firefox,
we decreased memory usage from 13 GB per process to 3 GB per process during
link-time optimization phase, and build time  has been decreased from 18 hours
with the old pass to around 16 minutes with the improved pass. This is a major
improvement and enables us to analyze programs that could not have been
analyzed before without excessive resource use.

To our knowledge it is the first open-source implementation able to compute
interprocedural points-to analysis for projects like Firefox using reasonable
resources.  The code currently exists as a patch to GCC. It works well in
production environment and has been checked to give conservatively correct
results. We work toward including the code in mainline GCC.
