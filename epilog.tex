In this work we have identified bitmaps as one of the most used data
structure in GCC and one of its biggest users, the interprocedural
points-to analysis. We have enhanced this algorithm with a new data
structure based on bloom filters, the Bloomap. This decrease memory usage
from 13 GB per process to 3 GB per process during link-time optimization
phase. Build time for Firefox has been decreased from 18 hours with the
old pass to around 16 minutes with the improved pass. This is a major
improvement and enables us to analyze programs that could not have been
analyzed before without excessive resource use.

The code currently exists as a patch to GCC, but will be merged into the
mainline.
